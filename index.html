    <div class="first">
        <p>According to Wikipedia, a car or an automobile is
             defined as a wheeled motor vehicle used for 
             transportation. The word “Automobile” is derived 
             from a Greek word “Autos” meaning self and a 
             Latin word “mobilis” meaning “movable”.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="second">
        <p>A classic car is an older automobile, typically 20 years
             or older, though definitions vary. The common theme 
             is of an older car of sufficient historical interest 
             to be collectable and worth preserving or restoring 
             rather than scrapping.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="third">
        <p>Today we are going to look at highbreed vehicles
             with designs from classic cars tuned with the latest 
             development and technology of this modern era.</p>

    <h4>Top Five Future Car Feaures</h4>
    <div class="last">
        <p>1.Car-to-Car Communication
            As cars get their own Internet connection, 
            They will communicate to tell what the flow of traffic
             is like. This  will also help prevent crashes by allowing 
             vehicles to alert one another.
            
            2.3D Gestures
            Instead of touchscreens, joysticks and buttons, We will
             control parts of our car by waving our hands.
            
            3.Biometric Scanners
            Biometric sensors can monitor heart-rate and breath rate
             for the driver in order to alert them of emergency or
              medical issues.
            
            4.Energizing Comfort
            This combines a bunch of the car’s functions to enhance
             passenger “wellness.” The system adjusts the car’s climate
              control, seat heating/cooling/ ambient lighting and the
               built-in fragrance.
            
            5.Self-Driven Cars
            This also a big feature of next generation where cars use
             inbuilt GPS and other navigation systems to self drive.</p>
